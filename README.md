# Hangout App
---

This is a new generation social application. We focus on social activities in real world and extend them onto the internet. You can either create an event or find an event to join.


## 1. Create an event

We simplify the whole process of holding an event. Users can set up time and location and invite people wanted. We make it easier for event holders to manage their events in following ways:

* Notify invitees of the time and location change
* Confirm the availability of invitees


## 2. Find an event

We show all the available events on the map and users can toggle to select time interval and different events will be shown.

To join an event, user can drop a pin on the map and opt join. The event holder will get a notification and choose whether to confirm the request.

Besides of map, users can also use list view to find the events they want, which is equivalent to map search.
